        <h2>About</h2>
        <br><br>
        <p>Growing up in Trinidad and Tobago, my interest in politics has been shaped by my experience as a Child Rights Ambassador, the growing instability of my country's closest neighbour (Venezuela), and a local electoral scandal involving Cambridge Analytica.</p>
        <br><br>
        <p>My studies in Applied Mathematics and Government at Dartmouth College, along with my experience working at the Political Violence Field Lab and Shell PLC, has furthered my desire to understand elite decision making, political violence, and Caribbean regional security. I employ both quantitative and qualitative methods to investigate these topics. Read my analyses <a href = "html/analysis.html">here</a>.</p>
        <br><br>
        <p>Outside of political analysis, my biggest passion is photography. For as long as I can remember, I've been enamoured by photography's ability to capture the beauty of fleeting moments. A collection of my work can be found <a href="html/art.html">here</a>.</p>
